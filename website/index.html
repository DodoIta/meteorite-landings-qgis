      <h2>CONCEPT</h2>
      <p>Meteorite Landings is a data visualization project. It shows the
      meteorites which fell to the Earth listed per decades, starting from 1950
      to 2013.</p>
      <h2>ANALYSIS</h2>
      <p>The meteorites themselves are represented with coloured circles.
      By hovering them you can find the following information: </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Name of the meteorite</li>
        <li>Composition</li>
        <li>Weight, declared ad kilograms</li>
        <li>Year of collision</li>
      </ul>
      <p>In addition, the circles representing the meteorites show different
      colours based on their weight: </p>
      <ul>
        <li id="lighter">Very light</li>
        <li id="light">Light</li>
        <li id="medium">Medium</li>
        <li id="heavy">Heavy</li>
        <li id="heavier">Very heavy</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The weight values have been computed so that each class contains the
      same amount of meteorites.</p>
      <h2>CONCLUSIONS</h2>
      <p>Since in each decade the classes contain the same amount of meteorites
      filtered by weight, it is easy to see how most of the meteorites are
      actually quite light, a few kilograms at most.</p>
      <p>It is also interesting to notice how the number of registered meteorites
      has increased during the years, but their medium weight has decreased.
      That is probably not a coincidence: the fact that a large majority of
      meteorites weights less than one kilogram means that the technology
      improvements has made us able to identify the smaller ones.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, as the Antarctica is the continent with the most
      collisions, acknowledging that during the '50s none has been registered may
      seem strange. But that's proof of the fact that human expeditions to
      Antarctica boosted after the '50s.</p>
      <p>The project has been made using QGIS to store and style the dataset,
      then the qgis2web plugin to export the map templates.</p>
