      <h2>CONCEPT</h2>
      <p>Meteorite Landings is a data visualization project. It shows the
      meteorites which fell to the Earth listed per decades, starting from 1950
      to 2010.</p>
      <p>The dataset is supplied by the Meteoritical Society and it is available
      at <a class="link "href="https://data.nasa.gov/Space-Science/Meteorite-Landings/ak9y-cwf9" target="_blank">this</a>
      link. It consists of 45716 entries, and it contains information on all of
      the known meteorite landings, updated at May 2013, and includes various
      fields. The ones used for this visualization are the name, the composition,
      the mass, the year of collision and the location.</p>
      <p>I slimmed down the dataset by listing the meteorites per decade. I
      chose to analyze the recent past because the number of registered
      meteorites before 1950 is very low. I also kept out the ones dated
      between 2010 and 2013 because their information is not complete: they
      probably were still being studied.</p>
      <h2>ANALYSIS</h2>
      <p>The meteorites themselves are represented with coloured circles.
      By hovering on them you can find the following information: </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Name of the meteorite</li>
        <li>Composition</li>
        <li>Weight, declared ad kilograms</li>
        <li>Year of collision</li>
      </ul>
      <p>In addition, the circles representing the meteorites show different
      colours based on their weight: </p>
      <ul>
        <li id="lighter">Very light</li>
        <li id="light">Light</li>
        <li id="medium">Medium</li>
        <li id="heavy">Heavy</li>
        <li id="heavier">Very heavy</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Finally, here are the total numbers of registered meteorites per
      decade: </p>
      <ul class="counts">
        <li>1950-1960: 212</li>
        <li>1960-1970: 397</li>
        <li>1970-1980: 4969</li>
        <li>1980-1990: 6822</li>
        <li>1990-2000: 11619</li>
        <li>2000-2010: 17757</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The weight values have been computed so that each class contains the
      same amount of meteorites.</p>
      <h2>CONCLUSIONS</h2>
      <p>Since in each decade the classes contain the same amount of meteorites
      filtered by weight, it is easy to see how most of the meteorites are
      actually quite light, a few kilograms at most.</p>
      <p>It is also interesting to notice how the number of registered meteorites
      has increased during the years, but their medium weight has decreased.
      That is probably not a coincidence: the fact that a large majority of
      meteorites weights less than one kilogram means that the technology
      improvements have made us able to identify the smaller ones.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, as the Antarctica is the continent with the most
      collisions, acknowledging that during the '50s none has been registered may
      seem strange. But that's proof of the fact that human expeditions to
      Antarctica boosted later. Looking at the decades, it is way more evident
      how the number of circles grew significantly in the recent past.</p>

      <p>The project was made using QGIS to store and style the dataset,
      then the qgis2web plugin to export the map templates.</p>
